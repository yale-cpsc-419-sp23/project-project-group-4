## ðŸ—“ Updates Timeline

- February 19: Skeleton code done
    - We have a code skeleton
        - the `website` folder contains the backend. That is, models (`models.py`), controllers (`views.py`), and routes (`views.py`) for the backend
        - the `templates` folder (inside the `website` folder) contains the frontend code
        - the `static` folder (inside the `website` folder) contains the static files (images, css, js, etc.)
- March 10: MVP done
    - Features:
        - Get, Post, and delete/recover/found lost items: Enable users to post a description of a lost item they are searching for, which is viewable by other users, 
        and remove it once found. The same feature applies to people who have found items.
        - UML diagram for database - see DatabaseUML.pdf
        - Database design for storing lost and found objects and information about users
        - Basic UI design of being able to scroll through main page and see items and descriptions
        - Note: Update lost items was not completed, however, we will complete it over the next iteration - We let Matthew know about this.
