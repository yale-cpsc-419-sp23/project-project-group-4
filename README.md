## 🗓 Updates Timeline

- February 19: Skeleton code done
    - We have a code skeleton
        - the `website` folder contains the backend. That is, models (`models.py`), controllers (`views.py`), and routes (`views.py`) for the backend
        - the `templates` folder (inside the `website` folder) contains the frontend code
        - the `static` folder (inside the `website` folder) contains the static files (images, css, js, etc.)

## 🤔 How to run?

1. Install the dependencies
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app with `python main.py` in the main directory
