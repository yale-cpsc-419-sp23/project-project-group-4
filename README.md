## ðŸ—“ Updates Timeline

- February 19: Skeleton code done
    - We have a code skeleton
        - the `website` folder contains the backend. That is, models (`models.py`), controllers (`views.py`), and routes (`views.py`) for the backend
        - the `templates` folder (inside the `website` folder) contains the frontend code
        - the `static` folder (inside the `website` folder) contains the static files (images, css, js, etc.)
- March 10: MVP done
    - Additional Features:
        - Get, Post, and delete/recover/found lost items: Enable users to post a description of a lost item they are searching for, which is viewable by other users, 
        and remove it once found. The same feature applies to people who have found items.
        - UML diagram for database - see DatabaseUML.pdf
        - Database design for storing lost and found objects and information about users
        - Basic UI design of being able to scroll through main page and see items and descriptions
        - Note: Update lost items was not completed, however, we will complete it over the next iteration - We let Matthew know about this.
- March 26: Alpha done
    - Additional Features:
        - Basic search functionality based on keywords
        - Item category search based on tags
        - Keyword suggestions
        - Date range search based on dates of when items were lost or found
        - UI improvements to make website more user friendly
        - Note: The update lost items feature proposed for the MVP was completed in this iteration âœ…
 - April 9: Beta done
    - Additional Features:
        - Bug fixes and stability improvements
        - Messaging system to connect people who lost items with people who found items
        - User profiles with basic data regarding what items they have lost and found, and how many
        - UI improvements to make website more visually appealing
        - Note: Integration of external messaging methods (email, phone) was not completing as we feel there is no need to have this given our current messaging system built into our app. It would not make any sense.
        - Additional: We have added Yale CAS Login within our app
 - April 23: Final done
    - Additional Features:
        - User login and authentication: Allow users to log in and authenticate their identity before using the web app, ensuring the privacy and security of user data (through Yale CAS Login)
        - Bug fixes and stability improvements
        - UI tweaks based on needs
        - Additional feature requests
        - Testing and performance optimization
        - Note: We have also added user profile pictures, improved messaging system similar to iMessage, and user names instead of netid
